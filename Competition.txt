* Mention the word "competition" in your subject line 
* Mention your forum user name. 
* Provide us with a clear, official title for your entry (as opposed to "here's my entry: rom.sms"). 
* Provide us with a description of the entry if you would like one to be included. We will copy whatever in your e-mail looks like a description to the corresponding pages. 
* If it's a hack, specify which game/version/CRC. 
* If it's a music, specify if it's an original track or a cover (specify which game, which track). 
* Including cover art makes you 20% more awesome :) 
* Including sources (for both music and code) makes you 256% more awesome. :)
