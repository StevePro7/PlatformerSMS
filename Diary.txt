Morning
Big optimization today: took out the myabs() function and replaced with custom logic
to determine which sign to check and noticed a massive improved noticeable more on 60FPS NTSC
However, there is still an issue when there are too many platform blocks so use sparingly!
Ditto applies to optional platform blocks
Finally, if having any issue with level not rendering correctly then ensure full re-build!

Big change!
RE-architect clear VRAM + content load esp. transition from begin screen to init screen
Before doing this there were graphics artefacts on screen when going from game over back to begin

This task included re-factoring the asm_manager implementation code into its own *.c file
I was meaning to do this but was now forced upon me...

Evening
Sprite flash when transition between levels
i.e. finish level X and load level X+1 player sprite would "flash"
so had to workraound this issue by not drawing sprite last frame of transitioning screen
