IMPORTANT
When designing levels ensure that the last line ends with carriage return
i.e.
1..11
1234561234512345

This will ensure CRLF for the level and COLS + 2 continues to work
Otherwise the first byte of the next level will be used..! 


bool true	1
bool false	0

but return type unsigned char otherwise warnings / errors
