TODO
Re-arrange the tile bitmap so that the first index zero is 16x16 blank
And move the platform to #10. Also make a red gem while there
PS: do I want to do a 8x8 of all the corresponding tiles while there?

IMPORTANT
When designing levels ensure that the last line ends with carriage return
i.e.
1..11
1234561234512345

This will ensure CRLF for the level and COLS + 2 continues to work
Otherwise the first byte of the next level will be used..! 


bool true	1
bool false	0

but return type unsigned char otherwise warnings / errors
