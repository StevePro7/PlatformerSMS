# PlatformerSMS
Placeholder repo for PlatformerSMS

29/01/2019
Build - maybe not able to split into C files
as need SMSlib.h in main.c for SMS header

Compare AstroForce with current build:
All tiles are loaded once and only once into Tile Viewer [VRAM]
just like Wonderboy
However, the Sprite Viewer is constantly changing [for animations]
Therefore, could current tiles in Tile Viewer
32 tile wide	8*4
01. 64 font
02. 64 back
Leaves 32*10=320 tiles left
Divide by 8 tiles per animations	16*32px
Equals enough space for 40 animations	8*40=320

Can I dynamically determine the width of any given level by
dividing the array[] count by 12 as will always be 12 height
e.g.
should be 204 for "default" level i.e. 17 * 12 = 204 (17 = 15 + 2)

TODO
Re-arrange the tile bitmap so that the first index zero is 16x16 blank
And move the platform to #10. Also make a red gem while there
PS: do I want to do a 8x8 of all the corresponding tiles while there?

IMPORTANT
When designing levels ensure that the last line ends with carriage return
i.e.
1..11
1234561234512345

This will ensure CRLF for the level and COLS + 2 continues to work
Otherwise the first byte of the next level will be used..! 


bool true	1
bool false	0

but return type unsigned char otherwise warnings / errors
